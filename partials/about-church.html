  <!-- Church History Section -->
  <div class="history-section">
    <h3 class="section-heading">Our History</h3>
    <p>Dharmikta Mandali was founded in 2009 with 25 believers who gathered in a small rented room in Bhanjyang, Lalitpur. Through continuous prayer, God revealed Proverbs 14:34, which became the foundation for our name – Dharmikta Mandali (Righteousness Church).</p>
    
    <p>Within a month, the room was full, so we rented an additional room and joined them. Just two months later, we had to expand again as more people joined the fellowship.</p>
  
    <p>As the church continued to grow, we moved to Bhaisepati, where we:</p>
    <ul class="history-list">
      <li>First moved our church on rented Space</li>
      <li>Later relocated to another rented land and built a second church building</li>
      <li>Finally moved to our current permanent space built on our own land</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>Today, we gather freely to worship and serve, continuing the journey that began with prayer and faith. We are thankful for God's guidance and the growth He has brought to Dharmikta Mandali.</p>
